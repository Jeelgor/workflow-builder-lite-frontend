## How AI was used

AI tools were used during development mainly for:

* Syntax help
* Getting a basic understanding of Folder Structure and how we make code more reusable as much as we can.
* Debugging errors

## What was implemented manually

* Making decisions on how the frontend user flow will work, how many components are needed, how we can reuse code as much as possible, and writing the component code.
